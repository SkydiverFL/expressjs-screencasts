# Code For The ExpressJS Screencasts at WatchMeCode.net

Hi there!

You've come to the repository for the code I wrote while producing my ExpressJS screencast series
at [WatchMeCode.net](http://watchmecode.net).

If you're looking for the code to go with a particular episode, want to copy and paste something
you saw and like, or would simply like to follow along - you're in the right place!

I've numbered folders in this repository to go with each episode, and have left them all at
the end-point of the episode. 

## WatchMeCode: Express Screencast Series

This is a multi-part series, currently consisting of 9 episodes. I've taken the MongooseJS
code that I wrote for my previous series and have started to build a basic website with it
using Express. But instead of focusing on the basics and intro level material for Express,
I've taken this to new heights by showing you all my secrets to creating well organized,
highly flexible Express applications.

While you won't find a "how to install Express" episode in this series, you will find something
that meets just about every other "how do i..." need, when it comes to the advanced topics
of really managing and organizing Express applications.

So sit back, relax and get ready to turn your Express apps into something worth talking about
and showing off!
